# unity-twitch-input

Control unity games from twitch chat! :video_game: :tv:

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qmj0l67l7hfw6ic7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bengreenier/unity-twitch-input)

A drop in replacement for [Unity Input](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html) that enables [twitch](https://twitch.tv) chat to drive Unity experiences. I wanted to enable folks watching [my stream](https://twitch.tv/ben_greenier) to control things as we build experiences, games, and frameworks together. Further, I didn't want folks to have to use an entirely new input system to support this sort of functionality. :sunglasses:

## Using

+ Secure a twitch chat access token [from here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi)
+ Provide that access token by creating a `ChatAccessToken` asset
